# JavaChatroom
A java chat room for LAN user.   
This is an application I followed a Java book to develop a chatroom.
P.S.: For this project, I used text document to store the data of user and chatting records (to save time). If you want to use the application to build a robust system, you should try to use database like MySQL.
